# Choose Your Own Analytic Adventure

I'm trying to pull together a set of tutorials on data analysis in R and hopefully Python. This is mostly for me to make sure I understand and can explain various statistical and machine learning methods.

The plan is to have a brief description of a method, when it is appropriate to use, and the basic assumptions that are being made. This will be followed by some example code, and some interpretation.

I'd like to eventually go deep into the mathematics that underly the methods, but that is probably not going to happen any time soon.

## Structure

Currently I'm thinking about the methods I know about in three different sections:

* Exploratory
* Inductive
* Deductive

From my experience it seems that lots of the statistical techniques fall into a more deductive framework while inductive reasoning is used more with induction.
