    "contents" : "Introduction\n========================================================\n\nThe following collection of posts will (hopefully) be helpful to anyone who would like to better understand how to perform data analysis. I'll be trying to talk to three different groups in particular:\n\n* Analysts\n* Managers\n* Parents\n\nI'm choosing these three groups for specific reasons, primarily because I can, or have fallen into each of these categories before, so I may actually be able to say something of value to these groups. I'll go into more detail on each of these groups below, but first I want to go over some general assumptions that I'll be making.\n\nFirst, I don't expect you to know much about codeing. I do expect a decent familiarity with computers so you can install programs, find files in a folder, and connect to the internet and go find some additional help (with some guideance). I will be showing some code, and if you have a project that you are doing the examples I give should be enough to get you started. \n\nSecond, I'm not going to assume a stellar math background. In these posts I'll try to be fairly practical. All of the concepts that will be posted have a lot of math behind them (and for those who are interested I'll try to provide ways to go deeper), but the truth is you just need to understand the concepts and assumptions to perform the analyses, at least that has been my experience.\n\nBack to the categories, the first one is analyst. By analyst I'm thinking of someone who actually plays with data on a fairly regular basis.^[1] Perhaps you already do statistical analysis in a program like SAS, R or Stata, maybe you are a graduate student. For you I hope that I can help provide some guidence on the assumptions you are making in your analysis, how to automate your workflow (a bit), or show some new techniques that may be a better way of approaching a problem you are facing.\n\nFor managers, I'm guessing that you aren't interogating data as often as your analysits, but you do need to understand what they are saying, and talk coherently about what they are finding. Again it mostly deals with the assumptions that are being made. I also hope that by understanding the limitations or opportunities afforded by these methods you could find new value from data that you have, or ask some different questions.\n\nParents are the last category I hope to write to. I understand that parents (unless it is your job) don't have a lot of time, or inclination, to rigorusly evaluate the barrage of advice that comes. These posts may however give you a way of thinking about how you could test to see what is actually working for your kids, and what isn't. It'll still probably take more time than you have, but it may help you think about fun experiments to do on/with your kids, which was always a helpful escape for me^[2]. Some practical examples for parents would be if you are wondering if your kids are sleeping less this month than last month, or evaluating if their new friends are making them act more snide over time.\n\nAnother way of categorizing the groups would be practitioner, informed decision maker, and dabbler; but I think grounding it into real professions that I have experiece with will make the examples a little more down to earth. \n\nReally the main point of writting this is selfish; I want to make sure that I understand these concepts well enough to explain them to others and teaching is the best way to do this. If anyone esle gets a benefit from these posts I'll count it as a very gratifying bonus. \n\nWith that brief introductino out of the way let's get on with the usefull information.\n\n\n[1] If you don't understand the phrase \"play with data\" I would argue that you just have seen how much fun it can be, and I feel sorry for you. To be honest I felt that way for a very long time, but after seeing what questions could be reasonably answered with proper data analysis I fell in love with it, thus this book.\n\n[2] I once gave a talk at a conference and my bio said somthing to the effect of \"spends free time playing with data and analyzing his children\". I stand by that statement, and think everyone should try it.",
